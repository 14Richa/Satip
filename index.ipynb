    "> Satip provides all the functionality necessary for retrieving, transforming and storing EUMETSAT data\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Entire EUMETSAT SEVIRI RSS archive available as one big Zarr array (tens of TBytes) in Google Public Datasets bucket, spatially reprojected, and saved in a very space-efficient way.\n",
    "- [ ] Automatic job to update archive on GCP from EUMETSAT's new API once a day.\n",
    "- [ ] Documentation.  Possibly user-editable.  (source on GitHub, maybe?)\n",
    "- [ ] A few example Jupyter Notebooks showing how to load the data, train simple ML model, and compute metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Test transform options\n",
    "- [ ] Move the metadata db to a GCP oriented process\n",

    "Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Should we also be downloading images taken at night?\n",
    "* What metadata is relevant and should be stored for each EUMETSAT dataset?\n",
    "* What was the conclusion of comparing EUMETSAT file formats?\n",

    "\n",
    "* Should streamline this and also create a batch script - need mac equivalents\n",

    "See the [jupyter-matplotlib docs for more info](https://github.com/matplotlib/jupyter-matplotlib).  The short version is to run these commands from within the `sat_image_processing` env:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager\n",
    "jupyter labextension install jupyter-matplotlib\n",

    "### Publishing to PyPi\n",
    "\n",
    "To publish the `satip` module to PyPi simply run the following from the batch_scripts directory\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pypi_publish <anaconda_dir>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `<anaconda_dir>` is the path to your anaconda directory - e.g. C:\\Users\\User\\anaconda3\n",
    "\n",
    "When prompted you should enter your PyPi username and password\n",
    "\n",
    "After this you will be able to install the latest version of satip using `pip install satip`\n"
