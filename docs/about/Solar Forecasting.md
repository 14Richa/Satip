# Solar Forecasting

Forecasting solar photovoltaic (PV) power production is hard: As clouds move over PV panels, the power output moves up and down rapidly. To keep the energy grid in balance, operators need to have readily available power generation reserves which usually come from fossil fuel sources.

If we have more accurate predictions of how much electricity a PV installation will produce over the next few hours then we can reduce the amount of fossil fuel reserve required. By making solar energy more predictable we will make it easier for the grid to absorb more PV generation and for investors to reduce the risk of solar investments. Supported by the European Space Agency and many other partners we are investigating how to use Machine Learning and satellite images to improve forecasts of PV power generation.

The `Satip` module provides all of the functionality necessary for retrieving, transforming and storing the EUMETSAT data needed in the OCF solar forecasting project.
